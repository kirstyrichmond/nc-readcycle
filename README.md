## Description

Readcycle is a full stack mobile app that encourages sustainability by enabling individuals to give away and receive books. Within a couple of minutes, users can upload their entire bookshelf using the in-built barcode scanner, and connect with other users giving away or looking for books in their area.

The idea came when thinking collectivity about creating a sustainable app that would encourage the reduction of waste, be user-friendly and engaging, and provide a practical and efficient solution to everyday problems. We gravitated towards the idea of a book exchange app since books are an invaluable commodity that should be available to everybody, including individuals with little or no income, and are often left unused or thrown away. Therefore, we decided to create an app that would provide users with an alternative choice that would be just as convenient, yet much more sustainable.

Recycle books with Readcycle and letâ€™s tackle climate change together.
